***Important Reminder: 

We make our best effort to keep these downloadable files up to date, but frequencies can change during the season. Check the latest Frequency Sheet on Race Day. We have videos to help you update frequencies at the track.

Tip: Back up any changes you've made to your scanner when you get home to avoid losing your custom settings.
